🚗 Road Lane Localization Using OpenCV

📌 Project Overview
Road Lane Localization is a computer vision-based project that detects road lane markings from images and video streams using OpenCV. The system processes real-time video input to identify lane lines and overlay them on the road, which can assist in autonomous driving and lane departure warning systems.
🎯 Objective
Detect lane lines under different lighting and weather conditions.
Perform real-time video frame processing.
Improve robustness in challenging scenarios (sharp turns, faded lanes, shadows).
Enhance detection using perspective transformation and thresholding techniques.
Provide a base system for autonomous driving assistance.
🧠 Abstract
Lane detection is a critical component of autonomous driving systems. It provides essential semantic road information that helps in navigation and safety.

This project uses classical computer vision techniques such as:

Edge Detection (Canny)
Hough Transform
Perspective Transformation
Thresholding
Camera Calibration
The system detects lane markings and overlays them onto the original video stream, improving road perception and assisting in lane guidance.

🔍 Existing System
Uses Canny Edge Detection for preprocessing.
Applies Hough Transform for line detection.
Processes video frame-by-frame.
Uses Region of Interest (ROI) masking.
❌ Limitations
Limited adaptability to complex road conditions.
Difficulty handling faded or non-standard lane markings.
Limited contextual understanding (no traffic analysis).
🚀 Proposed Enhancements
Improved robustness using adaptive thresholding.
Lane direction detection.
Traffic condition analysis (future scope).
Enhanced accuracy in real-world scenarios.
